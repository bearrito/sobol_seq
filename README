== Goal ==
Wanted to take a piece of python that I did not write and see how long it would take me to port the critical sections to cython.
I slightly restructed the very-procedural code into something more functional.

In this case profiling identified the function I've named i4_sobol0 as the most critical section.

== Profiling snapshot ==
The below stats are for a 20-Dimensional sequence of 1M points.

== Original Readme ==
Cleaned up version of John Burkardt and Corrado Chisari's python sobol sequence
implementation. 
Original version is available from
http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/sobol/sobol.html

== Installation and Usage ==
Copy to your python lib directory.

Import using normal method. Use i4_sobol to generate a single Sobol vector, or
i4_sobol_generate to generate a Sobol sequence.
